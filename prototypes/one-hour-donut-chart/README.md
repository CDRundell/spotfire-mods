## How to get started (with development server)

- Open a terminal at the location of this example.
- Run `npm start`. This will install necessary tools and start a development server.
- Start editing, for example `src/index.js`.
- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and connecting to the development server.

## Working without a development server

- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and then browse for, and point to, the _manifest_ in the `src` folder.
